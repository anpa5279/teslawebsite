Studies of single-wake systems have shown that coherent wake vortices have a regular and predictable periodicity. A growing literature of dual-wake studies has shown that multi-wake systems are more stochastic than single-wake systems, and their dynamics are highly dependent on the spacing between the wakes. Here, we expand on this literature by investigating three-wake systems and find that the coherent dynamics of the wakes are highly intermittent. We use proper orthogonal decomposition to extract the most energetic modes of the three-wake system at six bluff-body spacings that span a range of dynamical “regimes.” After describing the time-dependent behavior of the interacting wakes in these regimes, we use a statistical approach to describe the relative phase between oscillations in each of the wakes, identifying regimes where oscillations are more or less random. Interestingly, the wake oscillations are less random when the bluff bodies are positioned very close and relatively far from each other. In between these two extremes, an intermediary regime is identified where the wake oscillations are almost completely random; this finding parallels data from the dual-wake literature. Finally, we discuss the implications of the observed behaviors and possible future directions for this work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Active subspaces for wind plant surrogate modeling</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/active-subspaces-for-wind-plant-surrogate-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/active-subspaces-for-wind-plant-surrogate-modeling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Assessment of wind parameter sensitivity on ultimate and fatigue wind turbine loads</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/assessment-of-wind-parameter-sensitivity-on-ultimate-and-fatigue-wind-turbine-loads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/assessment-of-wind-parameter-sensitivity-on-ultimate-and-fatigue-wind-turbine-loads/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Exploring Optimization Opportunities in Four-Point Suspension Wind Turbine Drivetrains through Integrated Design Approaches</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/exploring-optimization-opportunities-in-four-point-suspension-wind-turbine-drivetrains-through-integrated-design-approaches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/exploring-optimization-opportunities-in-four-point-suspension-wind-turbine-drivetrains-through-integrated-design-approaches/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wind Turbine Optimization with WISDEM</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-turbine-optimization-with-wisdem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-turbine-optimization-with-wisdem/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Optimization Under Uncertainty for Wake Steering Strategies</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-for-wake-steering-strategies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-for-wake-steering-strategies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Numerical study of acoustic radiation dynamics of a Rankine vortex</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-study-of-acoustic-radiation-dynamics-of-a-rankine-vortex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-study-of-acoustic-radiation-dynamics-of-a-rankine-vortex/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper investigates the problem of sound radiation by a perturbed Rankine vortex, which is important for understanding the nature of vortex flows and acoustic radiation generated by them. This problem is difficult to simulate numerically due to the sharp boundary between the vortex and potential flows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We consider quadrupole and higher mode radiation as well as the dynamics of tonal acoustic radiation generated by a perturbed vortex with a gradual transition to lower harmonics. In addition, we consider the transition of a stationary Rankine vortex to a perturbed state under small external perturbation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mathematical description of the problem is based on Euler equations. Numerical simulation is performed on unstructured grids using a high accuracy EBR (Edge Based Reconstruction) scheme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, our paper aims to study the generation of acoustic radiation by a perturbed Rankine vortex. In addition, we verify the possibility of correct numerical simulation for complex fundamental vortex dynamics problems. In particular, the applicability of high accuracy numerical algorithms on unstructured grids to simulate such problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Optimization under uncertainty of site-specific turbine configurations</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-of-site-specific-turbine-configurations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/optimization-under-uncertainty-of-site-specific-turbine-configurations/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wind farm turbine type and placement optimization</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-farm-turbine-type-and-placement-optimization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/wind-farm-turbine-type-and-placement-optimization/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Effect of Flame Spacing and Flow Velocity on the Dynamics of Three Interacting V-Flames</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flame interaction is a phenomenon that occurs in a number of combustion devices and can change both the time-averaged shape and dynamical behavior of flames. In this study, we investigate the impact of flame spacing and bulk flow velocity on the time averaged characteristics of three, two-dimensional, bluff-body stabilized V-flames. Velocity fields and flame edges are extracted from particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to quantify the differences in behavior of these flames at three flame spacings and two bulk flow velocities with Reynolds numbers of 4000 and 8000 based on bluff-body diameter. Higher bulk flow velocities cause the flame intersection point to move downstream. Increasing the bluff-body spacing also moves the intersection point farther
downstream. Reducing bluff-body spacing causes the recirculation zone behind the bluff bodies to significantly diminish and reduces flame brush growth. Discussion of the impact of these geometric and flow parameters is discussed and plans for future work are provided.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical simulation of acoustic waves scattering by isolated vortex structures</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-simulation-of-acoustic-waves-scattering-by-isolated-vortex-structures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/numerical-simulation-of-acoustic-waves-scattering-by-isolated-vortex-structures/</guid><description>&lt;p>The problem of sound scattering by an isolated vortex is not only interesting to study, but it is also fundamental for understanding the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex flow, including the process of sound generation by turbulence. Understanding the sound generation process is essential for many practical applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When turbulence is represented by a distribution of localized vortices with certain static properties, the acoustic field scattered by such a flow is a superposition of scattered acoustic fields from each vortex. Therefore, the description of the elementary event of sound scattering sound by an isolated vortex can be used to predict the impact of turbulence on the acoustic field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the numerical simulation of this problem, we used a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena. Thus, we modeled the problem using a system of linearized Euler equations, in which a vortex is defined as a background field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the goals of this study was to test the ability of the EBR (Edge-Based Reconstruction) numerical scheme to model considered problems on unstructured grids and to assess its accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches. Thus, we used the EBR scheme (the fifth-order scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction), implemented in a highly parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we showed the simulation results of the plane acoustic wave scattering by isentropic Gaussian-core vortex with a constant circulation velocity. We also provided the study of grid convergence to the benchmark solution. Besides Cartesian grids, we used quasi-uniform unstructured triangular grids and demonstrated that the results are almost identical for the same number of grid points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also consider the problem of the cylindrical point source acoustic wave scattering by the Rankine vortex. We perform simulations on unstructured grids and compare the results of different numerical approaches: a finite-volume approach (NOISEtte EBR), a finite element approach (Actran DGM), and a finite-difference (Cabaret scheme).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results confirm that NOISEtte and its numerical method can be successfully used to simulate the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex structures.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
